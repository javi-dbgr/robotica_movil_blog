        <h2 class="content-subhead">FSM and state classes</h2>
        <p>
          I made a kind of "framework" that allows me to better
          separate the implementations of different states and
          to quickly scalate to more states. An explanation of
          this can be found <a href="../FSM-framework/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </p>


        <h2 class="content-subhead">First approach</h2>
        <p>
          First I decided to use the bumper, and came with the following FSM:
        </p>

        <p>
          The timers are chosen randomly, and varying the range you can
          obtain different results. For example, at first I thought that
          the best way to do it was to set short timers, so that
          the robot would stick to the walls. There were two problems:
          First, the robot would get stuck in the corners. Another problem
          was that when it entered a room, it could not get out.
          The following video shows the second problem:
        </p>

        <p>
          At that same time I realised that the methods to access the
          bumper state were giving me problems, so I started using the
          laser. Since there was no physical contact anymore,
          the GoBackward state was no longer needed, so I removed it:
        </p>

        <img class="pure-img-responsive" src="images/diagrama_2.png" alt="diagram 2">

        <p>
          I also put larger ranges for the timers, and changed the
          probability distribution, slightly favoring smaller
          timers(i.e. smaller turns) to favor the current direction
          of movement, without losing the possibility of making bigger turns.
        </p>
        <p>
          By that time, I also added the DoSpiral state:
        </p>

        <img class="pure-img-responsive" src="images/diagrama_3.png" alt="diagram 2">

        <p>
          DoSpiral activates with a certain probability, currently at 1%.
        </p>
