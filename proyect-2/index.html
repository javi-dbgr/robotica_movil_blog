        <h2 class="content-subhead">First step: color segmentation</h2>
        <p>
          The first thing I needed to do was to apply a color segmentation
          to the input image, in order to detect the red line.
        </p>

        <img class="pure-img-responsive" src="images/image_1.png" alt="filtered red line">

        <h2 class="content-subhead">Selecting a portion of the image</h2>
        <p>
          For the line coordinates(in pixels) to be calculated, a portion
          of the image has to be selected:
        </p>

        <img class="pure-img-responsive" src="images/image_2.png" alt="selected portion">

        <h2 class="content-subhead">Calculating the center of mass</h2>

        <p>
          "cv2.moments()" does this, returning the coordinates in pixels.
          I then printed them in the image for clarity:
        </p>

        <img class="pure-img-responsive" src="images/image_3.png" alt="center of mass">

        <h2 class="content-subhead">Getting the error</h2>

        <p>
            The error is simply the x coordinate of the pixels that
            are in the middle of the image minus the x coordinate of
            the center of mass:

        <h2 class="content-subhead">proportional control on angular velocity</h2>

        <p>
            Keeping the linear velocity constant and low, I implemented
            the proportional controller, and tweaked the constant until
            I had almost no oscilation. Then I kept increasing the speed
            until the p controller couldn't handle by itself.
            velocity = w_K_p * error
        </p>

        <h2 class="content-subhead">Adding the derivative part</h2>

        <p>
            Then I implemented the derivative part, simply by adding
            the difference of errors multiplied by a constant:
            velocity = w_K_p * error + w_K_d * (error - last_error).
            I spent quite some time tweaking the constants while
            increasing the speed until it couldn't handle more of it.
        </p>

        <h2 class="content-subhead">Adding the proportional control to the linear velocity</h2>

        <p>
            I did a linear function that takes the error and returns a
            velocity. If the error is less that a certain threshold, it returns
            the max velocity. If the error is bigger that another threshold,
            it returns the velocity that the pd controller of the angular
            velocity can tolerate. I also added a "smoother" that prevents
            abrupt changes in the velocity.

        <p>
            I managed to stop the clock at ~1.33.
