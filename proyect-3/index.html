        <h2 class="content-subhead">VFF basic explanation</h2>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li> Targets generate an attractive force on the robot (green) </li>
            <li> Obstacles generate a repulsive force on the robot (red) </li>
            <li> Adding them with weights you get a vector that guides the robot correctly (black) </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2 class="content-subhead">Repulsive vector</h2>
        <p>
          In order to calculate the repulsive vector, each laser measure
          has to be scaled according to the distance measured, and
          then all of them are added up.
        </p>
        <p>
            A hyperbole is in charge of scaling each measure:
        </p>

        <img class="pure-img-responsive" src="images/image_2.png" alt="selected portion">
        <p>
            The closer the obstacle is, the more it influences the sum,
            but with two thresholds: if its to far, it returns 0.
            If it is in a certain close range, it returns the same
            large value(does not tend to infinite).
            Moreover, I only kept the part of the vector that is
            perpendicular to the direction of movement. The other
            component is set to 0.
        </p>

        <h2 class="content-subhead">Atractive vector</h2>

        <p>
          In order for atractive vector to be calculated, the absolute
          coordinates of the car must be subtracted from the absolute
          coordinates of the goal, and if the new coordinate system is
          rotated, then the vector has to be rotated with opposite sign,
          to take that into account.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, the resulting value has to be scaled properly, using
            the following function:
        </p>

        <h2 class="content-subhead">Total vector</h2>

        <p>
         Once the vectors have been calculated, they are added with a
         individual weight. This constants, like everything else, have
         to be tweaked through trial and error.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now we have a vector that indicates where the robot should go, but the car actuators
          don't understand it, so we need to interpret it and send the correct commands to the car
          (velocity commands).
         </p>

        <h2 class="content-subhead">Commanding to the motors</h2>

        <p>
          Linear velocity: since we always want to go forward, we hold it constant.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the angular velocity, first I calculated the angle between the computed vector
            and the vector that points to the currect direction of the car. Then I thought of passing
            it to a linear function that returned the angle velocity, but it performed poorly so I swithed
            to a pd controller, where the error was the angle previously mentioned.
        </p>

        <h2 class="content-subhead">The problem</h2>

        <p>
          The car kept crashing with the second car. The problem was that it considered the
          objectives achieved from too far away, so I changed that for the beginning of the simulation.
